# Cisco Networking Labs Repository

Welcome to my Packet Tracer lab repository!

My goal is to showcase and reinforce hands-on networking skills and foundational knowledge. This includes core concepts, real-world configurations, and simulated enterprise-level designs — all built using Cisco Packet Tracer.
> This collection is a work in progress, with new labs continually added and updated as my skills develop. Please check back regurlarly for updates.

## Overview

This repo is divided into two major sections:

1. **Labs** — Smaller exercises to showcase specific CCNA topics like VLANs, OSPF, ACLs, NAT, and more.
2. **Projects** — Larger, multi-layered simulations representing realistic enterprise environments.

Each lab and project includes:
- A Packet Tracer `.pkt` file  
- A clear topology diagram and IP addressing table  
- Configuration and use notes

## Topics to Cover (Roadmap)

This is a roadmap of topics and technologies I plan to create labs for:

- VLANs, VTP, and trunking
- Inter-VLAN routing
- Static and dynamic routing (OSPF, EIGRP)
- DHCP (server, relay, excluded addresses)
- NAT and PAT
- ACLs (standard, extended, named)
- STP, RSTP, and loop prevention
- HSRP and redundancy
- Switchport security
- Subnetting and IP addressing schemes
- Layer 2 vs Layer 3 design
- Device naming and documentation best practices
- MAN layered topologies (access, distribution and core layers)
