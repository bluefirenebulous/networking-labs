# CISCO Packet Tracer Labs

This repository contains a growing collection of networking labs built using Cisco Packet Tracer. My goal is to showcase and expand on my foundational knowledge and networking concepts as I progress through my CCNA studies and beyond.
This collection is a work in progress, with new labs continually added and updated as my skills develop. Please check back regurlarly for updates.

Each lab will include:
- A `.pkt` Packet Tracer file
- A brief lab description
- Configuration steps or use example

## About Me

Iâ€™m an aspiring network engineer currently studying for the CCNA certification. I have hands-on experience working with real-world networks, including:

- Planning and installing network topologies for multi-story buildings
- Configuring routers, switches, and NAT for IP camera and alarm systems
- Troubleshooting connectivity issues and assigning IP addressing/subnets
- Running Ethernet cabling and installing RJ45 connectors
- Building home networks and lab environments from a young age

This repository serves as both a personal learning tool and a portfolio to showcase my skills to potential employers.
